    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Ingredients:
            <p>In large pot add meat, onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaves and dried peppers. Cover with water. (This uses my large 7 qt
            pot and fills it to the top!)</p>
        </li>
        <li>Add Seasonings:
            <p>Add chicken bouillon, oregano, cumin and salt, stir to combine. Bring to a boil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Skim:
            <p>After 30 minutes, skim the top of the pot to remove impurities from the bone cooking out. (will look like little bits of
            foam on the top)</p>
        </li>
        <li>Blend Peppers:
            <p>Remove the peppers (should be softened) and place in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, add up to 1/4 cup
            of broth if needed to help get a smooth consistency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Strain:
            <p>Strain the peppers if needed to remove bits of skin (if using a high powered blender this step is not necessary).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Combine:
            <p>Add the blended peppers into the broth and stir to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Season:
            <p>Add in the chili powder as desired to get a nice deep red color to the broth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Simmer:
            <p>Cover and continue to simmer for about 3 hours or until meat is tender and easily shredding on it’s own. (remove lid and
            give a stir every 40 minutes or so. Can also taste the broth once the meat is cooked through and adjust seasonings as
            needed).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Reserve Grease:
            <p>Skim the grease from the top of the broth (SAVE THIS!) pour the grease into a small skillet or saucepan, this is used
            for making the tacos if desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Remove the onion, garlic, carrots, and bay leaves from the broth. (these ingredients were in the broth for
        flavoring…people are more than welcome to eat and enjoy them, so save them if you want!)</li>
        <li>Serving:
            <p>Remove the meat from the broth and cut into large chunks for serving. Remove any bones.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
